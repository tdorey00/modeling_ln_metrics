# Modeling l<sub>n</sub>  Metric Trends in C++

The purose of this project is to model the trends in different functions of the general l<sub>n</sub> metric on sets of points in either 2d or 3d.  

### About the l<sub>n</sub> Metric:
The l<sub>n</sub> metric is one of the most frequently used distance metrics in common geometry.  Without even knowing what the l<sub>n</sub> metric you are most likely already familiar with the Euclidean distance metric:

This metric is something taught to all students as they go through general education.  However, there is a more general version of this metric for all n greater than or equal to 1:

If you use different values for n in the generalized form on the same two points you may realize that there emerges a trend in the distances as n increases.  That is the core purpose of this project.  To analyize and make conclusions about the trend that emerges.
